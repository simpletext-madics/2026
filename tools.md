# CLEF 2025 SimpleText: Tools

---

## Relevant literature & tools
###  Task 1: Text Simplification
* Cutting-edge language models such as LLaMA3 and Mistral are at the forefront of this process.

* - LLaMA3: Known for its state-of-the-art capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, LLaMA3 excels in maintaining the semantic integrity of scientific texts while simplifying them for a wider audience.
* - Mistral: A highly efficient model designed for complex text manipulation, Mistralâ€™s strengths lie in reducing verbosity while ensuring readability, making it an excellent tool for this task.
    
* These models use advanced fine-tuning techniques to adapt to scientific domains, ensuring clarity and precision in simplified outputs.


### Task 2: Controlled Creativity
Tools and libraries that specialize in this include:

* - MIRAGE: A library currently under development, MIRAGE leverages advanced hallucination detection models to identify misleading or incorrect outputs generated by language models. This ensures that the explanations provided are accurate and reliable.
Summeval: A robust evaluation framework used to assess the quality of generated summaries, which can be repurposed to verify the clarity of explanations for complex concepts.
* - Q2: A model designed for quality evaluation of text generation, helping to ensure that identified concepts are accurately explained without introducing errors.
    
* These resources, combined with intelligent algorithms, ensure that users receive trustworthy and comprehensible explanations for even the most difficult scientific concepts.
