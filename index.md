# CLEF 2026 SimpleText Track

## Scientific Text Simplification

  The SimpleText track aims to lead in relevant NLP/IR state-of-the-art opportunities and challenges. In 2021, the text simplification focus was chosen in light of the emerging generative models for NLP/IR tasks and the potential of AI/NLP models to improve the prototypical IR task of scientific information access. In 2025, after running the current setup for three consecutive years, we made significant changes in the track to address some of todayâ€™s main NLP/IR challenges.

  Our practice is to run tasks for 2-3 years, until a solid test collection and research community is established. After the first year in this new setup, we plan on continuing with the track setup in the same way at CLEF 2026, with incremental improvements inside the tasks.
